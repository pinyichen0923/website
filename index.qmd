## About Me

Hi! I am Pin-Yi Chen, an <span class="highlight"> MBA student at Cal Poly Pomona </span>, set to graduate in May 2025. Before graduate school, I worked in real estate marketing, sales, and business operations, which helped me develop a sharp understanding of customer needs, data-driven decision-making, and digital marketing.

Currently, I am focused on developing advanced skills in data wrangling, business analytics, and marketing intelligence using R, Tidyverse, and Quarto. My strength lies in blending technical knowledge with communication and market sense. I thrive on solving problems and simplifying complexity, whether it's a dataset or a business challenge.
